# üîçü§ñ RAG-Terraform-Vertex

## What is RAG?

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** is an AI technique that enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by combining information retrieval with generative capabilities. Instead of relying solely on model parameters, RAG retrieves relevant external documents from a knowledge base or data store, resulting in more accurate, contextual, and up-to-date responses.

This project demonstrates how to deploy a RAG architecture on **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** using **Terraform**, integrating **Vertex AI**, **Discovery Engine**, and **GCS**.

## üöÄ Prerequisites

* A Google Cloud project with billing enabled
* IAM role: Project Owner or Editor
* Basic knowledge of Google Cloud services and Terraform
* BAsic Knowledge of Generative AI, LLM and Embedding

## ‚öôÔ∏è Deployment Steps

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anudishu/RAG-Terraform-Vertex.git
cd RAG-Terraform-Vertex
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Open Google Cloud Shell or Your Local Terminal

You can run the following commands in Google Cloud Shell or your local terminal (with gcloud CLI configured).

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Enable Required Google Cloud APIs

```bash
gcloud services enable \
    compute.googleapis.com \
    aiplatform.googleapis.com \
    storage.googleapis.com \
    discoveryengine.googleapis.com
```
Verify APIs are enabled in the console:

Go to Google Cloud Console ‚Üí search for "AI Application"
Navigate to the AI Applications page
Click "Continue and activate the API" if prompted
Confirm all required APIs are listed and active

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Set Environment Variables

Replace placeholders with your actual values.

```bash
export PROJECT_ID="your-gcp-project-id"
export REGION="your-region"   # e.g. us-central1

gcloud config set project $PROJECT_ID
```

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Authenticate with Google Cloud

Authenticate your environment to allow Terraform and Python scripts to access Google Cloud services.

```bash
gcloud auth application-default login
```
Follow the authentication flow:

Copy the provided link from the terminal
Open it in your browser and login with your GCP account email
Copy the authorization code and paste it back in the terminal

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Initialize and Apply Terraform Configuration

This will provision all required infrastructure on Google Cloud:

* Discovery Engine Data Store
* Discovery Enginer Search Engine

```bash
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply -auto-approve
```

## üì• Load Data into RAG Data Store

After infrastructure is deployed:

### üîß 1. Update loaddata.py

Open `loaddata.py` Go to the end of file, and set the correct project and datastore IDs:

```python
PROJECT_ID = "your-gcp-project-id"
DATASTORE_ID = "your-datastore-id"
```

You can find the DATASTORE_ID in the Vertex AI Search console or from Terraform output.

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è 2. Run the Data Loader

```bash
python loaddata.py
```

This script will upload public documents("gs://cloud-samples-data/gen-app-builder/search/alphabet-investor-pdfs")  into your configured Vertex AI Search data store.

## üß™ Test the RAG Application

Once your data is indexed:

* Send test queries using the deployed app interface (if applicable)
* Or trigger inference via Vertex AI API
* Ensure that answers reflect content from the uploaded documents

Lets run with query on terminal.Open `query.py` Go to the end of file, and set the correct project and datastore IDs:

```bash
python query.py
```

Sample Test Queries
python# Example queries you can copy and paste for testing
QUERY = "who is ceo of google? what is total revenue of google?"

# Additional test queries: You just need to replace the query in "query.py"
QUERY = "What were Google Cloud earnings in 2024?"
QUERY = "Google Cloud financial results and revenue growth"
QUERY = "What is Google's market capitalization and stock performance?"
QUERY = "Google advertising revenue breakdown by quarter"
QUERY = "Alphabet Inc financial highlights and key metrics"
QUERY = "Google Cloud vs AWS market share comparison"
QUERY = "What are Google's main business segments and revenue sources?"
QUERY = "Google's investment in AI and machine learning initiatives"
QUERY = "YouTube revenue and user engagement statistics"
QUERY = "Google's data center locations and infrastructure investments"

## üßπ Clean Up Resources

To avoid incurring charges, destroy the provisioned infrastructure when no longer needed:

```bash
terraform destroy -auto-approve
```

## üìå Additional Notes

* Ensure your IAM permissions allow you to create and manage required resources.
